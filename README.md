## üöÄ Work on this project

If you would like to clone this project locally to work on yourself, please fork this repo on GitHub: https://github.com/AmyYukiBlip/NC_exhibition-curator-project

In your CL terminal, clone the repo locally with: `git clone <url>`
- Make sure to navigate to that new folder with `cd <file-path>`

You can run the app to view progress with `npm run dev`

You can build the project via vite with `npm run build`

### Vitest Testing

Run Vitest and see the tests in this repo with `npm run test`

> Vitest provides mocks (vi.mock, vi.fn, etc.) and helpers around running tests, assertions, setting globals. Vitest supports both happy-dom or jsdom for mocking DOM and browser APIs. However, they don't come with Vitest and needed to be installed separately. The environment in the config file is then updated for jsdom. (https://vitest.dev/guide/features.html)

> @testing-library/react is included to be able to render and test React components in the simulated DOM environment (via jsdom) and query for elements (e.g. screen.getByText).

### Lighthouse Accessibility Audit

To run an audit via CLI and see the report in the browser:

First run `npm run dev`

Next, in a second terminal, run `lighthouse <dev url> --view`

See all the options with `lighthouse --help`

### To host with netlify:

Update the build version with `npm run build`

Deploy to a draft URL with `netlify deploy`
- You may need to authorise Netlify with GitHub, and follow the prompts in the CLI

Deploy to the production URL with `netlify deploy ‚Äìprod`
